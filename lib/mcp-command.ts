// Who owns `/mcp`, decided the same way on the server and in the browser.
//
// The SDK loads pi's built-in MCP extension under the extension path
// `builtin:mcp`, and every command and tool it registers carries that path as
// its `sourceInfo.path`; `get_commands` hands the same field to the browser. A
// third-party extension that registers `/mcp` replaces the built-in one
// outright (the SDK drops a replaceable built-in that shares a command name),
// so the two never appear side by side. When several extensions register
// `/mcp`, pi names them `mcp:1`, `mcp:2`, … and none answers `/mcp` any more:
// pi looks a command up by that exact name, so a bare `/mcp` then runs no
// handler and reaches the model as text.
//
// The MCP host (`lib/mcp-host.ts`) stays inactive unless `/mcp` is the built-in
// one, the read-only policy (`lib/mcp-read-only-policy.ts`) recognises the
// built-in's tools by the path, and the composer opens Settings › MCP for a
// bare `/mcp` (ADR 0006). This module has no imports, so the browser can load it.
