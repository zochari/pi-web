// Pi Web's `mcp.json` writer (ADR 0006, "Writes"). The SDK's editors

// internals adapter loads) are the semantics this mirrors byte for byte: the
// file is parsed, the edit applied to the parsed object, and the whole document
// written back with the indentation of its first indented line ("  " when
// none) and always a trailing newline; `enabled: true` and `exposure:
// "codemode"` delete their key, and every key Pi Web does not know is kept.
// What the SDK lacks and this adds: a lock (proper-lockfile, plus an
// in-process queue so Pi Web's own writes never wait on each other's lock), an
// atomic write (a temporary file in the real directory, renamed over the real
// path, so a symbolic link stays a link), the mode (0600 for the global file,
// which may hold literal secrets; the project file, often committed, keeps
// its mode, 0644 when new), and a typed refusal that leaves a file it cannot
// parse untouched. The pi CLI writes without a lock, so the lock serializes
// Pi Web's writers only. `lib/mcp-config-file.test.mjs` pins the bytes against
// the SDK's own editors.
