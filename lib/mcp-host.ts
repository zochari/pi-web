// Pi Web decides which MCP servers a session connects (ADR 0006). The SDK's
// MCP extension is created with a `loadConfig` that returns no servers; this
// host reads `mcp.json` itself and hands the servers it wants to the extension
// through `pi.registerMcpServer()`:
//
// - Nothing connects until a session prompts. Browsing, switching sessions,
//   auto-naming and forking build wrappers that never prompt.
// - Before every prompt the wrapper asks the host to sync. Servers whose entry
//   changed are unregistered and registered again, so a change made anywhere
//   (the panel, `pi mcp add`, an editor, `git pull`) reaches every open session
//   on its next message without a reload. The prompt then waits up to 10 s for
//   servers with `direct` tools still connecting, and Stop ends that wait;
//   other servers connect in the background, and the SDK's extension waits
//   for them when a codemode script or `tool_search` needs them.
// - A host that has not prompted for PI_WEB_MCP_IDLE_MS unregisters its servers.
// - Project trust is read fresh on every sync too, never taken from the
//   wrapper (see desiredServers()).
//
// The extension does not report connection state, so the host watches the
// transports it creates through the factory pi-web gives it. A transport exists
// only once the extension has assigned the server's connection, which is what
// makes unregistering safe: before that, the extension's removal finds no
// connection to close, then connects the server anyway and loses it. What the
// host sees — every transport of a server, reconnects included, and what
// stops it registering one — goes to the status store (`lib/mcp-status.ts`)
// for Settings › MCP, keyed by the entry as its file holds it.
